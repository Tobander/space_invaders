# space_invaders
space_invaders.py is a simple version of the classic Space Invaders game produced by prompting the OpenAI Codex engine. I have not modified the generated code. Also, it doesn't show a score although i requested it in the prompt.
Codex is an AI system that translates natural language to code. In this case it's Python code. The prompt is a text snippet that is fed to the Codex engine for completion. Completed text is a program code.
